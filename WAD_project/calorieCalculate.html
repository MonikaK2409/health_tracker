                    <h3>What is a calorie? </h3>
        <p>Most people think of calories as only having to do with food and weight loss. However, a calorie is a unit of heat energy. A calorie is the amount of energy that is needed to raise 1 gram (g) of water by 1°C.  </p>

        <p>  This measurement can be applied to lots of different energy releasing mechanisms outside of the human body. For the human body, calories are a measure of how much energy the body needs to function.</p>
        <p>Food contains calories. Different food has different calorie counts, meaning that each food has a different amount of potential energy.</p>

        <p>    There are three basic types of foods that make up all the food that humans eat: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. These three different types of food have varying amounts of potential energy per g.</p>
            <p>The calorie breakdownsTrusted Source per g for each food type are as follows:</p>

            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> 4 calories per g</li>
                <li><strong>proteins:</strong>4 calories per g</li>
                <li><strong>Fats:</strong>9 calories per g</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Calculating daily calorie burn</h3>
            <p>Being able to work out how many calories are burned each day is essential to any person looking to maintain, lose, or gain weight.</p>
            <p>Knowing what factors contribute to calorie burning can help a person alter their diet or exercise program to accommodate the goal.</p>
        <p>An accepted method to calculate how many calories a person burns each day is the Harris-Benedict Formula.</p>
        <p>Originally developed in the early 20th century, it was revamped in 1984 and again in 1990 to help improve its accuracy.</p>
     <p>The Harris-Benedict formula is a relatively simple process in which a person multiplies their basal metabolic rate (BMR) by their average daily activity level.</p>
    <p>BMR is the number of calories a person burns by simply existing. BMR varies based on age, sex, size, and genetics. To calculate BMR, a person uses inches for height, pounds for weight, and years for age in the following formulas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong> For men:</strong> 66 + (6.2 x weight) + (12.7 x height) – (6.76 x age)</li>
   <li><strong>For women:</strong> 655.1 + (4.35 x weight) + (4.7 x height) – (4.7 x age)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The results of the BMR calculation are then used to multiply against the average daily activity of the person. Points are awarded based on how active a person is.</p>
<p>Points for activity levels are as follows:</p>    
<ul>
    <li>1.2 points for a person who does little to no exercise</li>
    <li>1.37 points for a slightly active person who does light exercise 1–3 days a week</li>
    <li>1.55 points for a moderately active person who performs moderate exercise 3–5 days a week</li>
    <li>1.725 points for a very active person who exercises hard 6–7 days a week</li>
    <li>1.9 points for an extra active person who either has a physically demanding job or has a particularly challenging exercise routine</li>
</ul>

<h3>Factors affecting calorie burn</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong> Age:</strong>  the older a person is, the fewer calories burned per day.</li>
    <li><strong>Sex:</strong> men burn more calories than women.</li>
    <li><strong>Amount of daily activity: </strong>those who move more, burn more calories.</li>
    <li><strong>Body composition:</strong> those with more muscle burn more calories than those who have less muscle.</li>
    <li><strong>Body size:</strong> larger people burn more calories than smaller people, even at rest.</li>
    <li><strong>Thermogenesis:</strong> this is the amount of energy the body uses to break down food.</li>
    <li><strong>Pregnancy: </strong>pregnant women burn more calories than non-pregnant women.</li>
    <li><strong>Breast-feeding:</strong> women who are breast-feeding also burn extra calories.</li>
</ul>
